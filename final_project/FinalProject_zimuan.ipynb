We hypothesized that if we increase or decrease the boundary, it will result in a large change in prediction result and accuracy. By conducting two analysis with different boundaries on the yelp park review dataset, it turns out that the prediction accuracy on the testing dataset has a 9% increase, proving our hypothesis correct."

    "\"Why are we interested in determing what's good?\" This question might arise in your mind when you read this report. In fact, we are always dealing with this problem, trying to find out what's good in real life. For a very simple example, imagine if you are taking an exam, what score will make you think you performed will on this test? A 90% or a 85%, or even above 97% if you have a very high standard for yourself. For another reference, if you are a vehicle hobbyist trying to find a second hand car, or components on from car dealers, what determines its' quality of goodness? Is having below 30000 miles distance driven solid for a good second hand car? This list goes on and on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are carrying out sentiment analysis, we are interested in both rating and the text part of the review. We care about the quality of the review. Very interestingly, in <b>*20 hilarious one star yelp reviews of national parks*</b>, we can see that many famous national parks have received malicious and irrelevant reviews. For example, in a one star review of Carlsbad Caverns National Park, the reviewer commented that \"Unless you find caves and rocks overwhelmingly fascinating then skip this\" makes us wonder about the quality of review. As a famous-for-cave park located in Mexico, why be there if there is no interest in caves at all? Do we contain similar reviews in San Diego Park reviews in yelp?\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific question we are approaching makes it very hard to search for similar studies, especially prior data science project, we can refer to standards for other industries. In Rolanstein's article <b>*What makes a good movie review*</b>, although he didn't discuss the numeric standards we mentioned above, he analyzed the qualitative side of making a good review, which is also important. He states that \"a good review should be reader-directed, not a vehicle of self-promotion for the critic. The main purpose of a review should be to clarify for the reader whether the movie is worth seeing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why I try to explain this is because you might be confused when seeing the overview and research question. Now that things are clear, I am especially interested in this question because I wonder to what extent will the result change, if we adjust the standard for something that's good? In this case, how much will changing the boundary for good reviews from 4 to 3 (maximum is 5) affect the prediction accuracy in a TF-IDF sentiment analysis? We will try to find an answer to this puzzle in this project.\n",

    "- In our dataset, the rating is between 0 to 5. My hypothesis is that changing the tipping point between good review and bad review by at least 1 point differential will result in a large effect on predicting the outcome of San Diego Park reviews.\n",
    "- By large effect, I indicate that there would be <b>at least</b> a 5-10% accuracy change on predicting the outcome by using TF-IDF for every point changed. For example, if we initially classify all the good ratings as ones that are above 4 <b>(inclusive)</b>, and change that boundary to 3, it will result in <b>at least</b> a 5-10% change in accuracy of prediction, regradless of increasing or decreasing.\n",
    "- I think this way because usually there is no fixed boundary in determining what's good, so if we drag that separation down or up, it's largely going to change the prediction, either in accuracy or results. Sometimes, there might be a review with a high rating (could be above 4) but with minor criticisms in the text review. On some other occasions, there might be a review with a lower rating, but has more positive words in it. These are all factors that can affect the process of sentiment analysis. Thus, changing the boundary of determing what's good will largely change the prediction."

The shift in numeric boundary between good and bad in park reviews does result in a change in prediction outcome. But this doesn't indicate causality by any means. We can't either conclude that by lowering boundary for good rating, the prediction accuracy using TF-IDF is improved."

    "- The study is made to analyze whether if there is a change in accuracy of prediction. Thus, it is guaranteed that the process of categorizing reviews to good or bad section will absolutely not harm the rights of the reviewer. Each reviewer have their freedom of speech and our categorization indicates no criticisms nor unsatisfaction to the bad reviews. It is only for seeing the change of prediction result.\n",
    "- The study puts the privacy of each individuals in priority as no personal information including gender, contact information,or age are exposed in the dataset. The dataset only includes information that are neccessary for our project.In addition, no assumption of gender, age, ethnic group, religious belief, or sexual preference is made towards each individual.We only look at the text itself.\n",
    "- The study is totally transparent as yelp review dataset is accessible. The reviewers are welcomed to commuicate and discuss with our results. If anyone is displeased being in the review, we can contact directly and that observation will be removed as we conduct a new set of result.\n",
    "- The study is justice and fair since we treat every single observation equally in the TF-IDF process. There is absolutely no artificial manipulation in the dataset which are attempted just to make the result more pleasing. This behavior is not tolerated."

    "However, there are many limitations to the study:\n",
    " - Due to limited time, we only did comparison on results of changing the boundary of good reviews from 4 to 3, which doesn't generalize for all circumstances. In other words, we have no idea what will happend to the prediction accuracy if we change the boundary from 5 to 4, 3 to 2, 1 to 3, 2 to 4 etc. Only comparing 4 and 3 doesn't give us the whole image and dynamic trends of changing the boundary.\n",
    " - The dataset we are using have observations with reviews that are not <b>ALL</b> included. Some long reviews ends with \"...\" which will definitely affect our result of sentiment analysis. If every review is included fully, the result will be more convincing and accurate than our current finding.\n",
    " - The argument passing in our TF-IDF vectorizer is also affect our result in a large extent. We set the maximum feature to be 2000 words. If the maximum feature is lowered or increased, the result will largely change. This limitation exposed this study's lack of completion due to time and human resources.\n",
    " - As we discussed in background and prior work, the qualitative side of the review is also very insightful and worthy to look at.Unfortunately we focused on the numeric part of the review, which is the \"good rating boundary\" effect. If there is more time, we will try to analyze whether if a review is qualified to analyze, while excluding those that are not quite helpful."
